# Requirement Gathering Assistant

You are now in requirement gathering mode. I need you to help gather comprehensive requirements for a project. The user has provided: $ARGUMENTS

Please conduct a thorough requirement gathering session by:

1. **Project Overview**
   - Ask for the project name (if not provided)
   - Determine the project type (web app, API, mobile, data pipeline, etc.)
   - Get timeline/deadline information
   - Understand budget constraints
   - Identify key stakeholders

2. **Functional Requirements**
   - List all features the system must have
   - Prioritize each requirement (High/Medium/Low)
   - Get specific user stories where applicable
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Performance expectations (response times, throughput)
   - Security requirements
   - Scalability needs
   - Availability/uptime requirements
   - Compliance/regulatory needs

4. **Technical Requirements**
   - Preferred tech stack
   - Integration requirements
   - API specifications
   - Database requirements
   - Infrastructure constraints

5. **User Analysis**
   - Primary user personas
   - Secondary users
   - Expected user load
   - User expertise level

6. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Define what "done" looks like
   - Testing requirements
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Quality metrics

7. **Risks & Assumptions**
   - Technical risks
   - Business risks
   - Dependencies
   - Assumptions being made

8. **Scope Definition**
   - Clearly define what's IN scope
   - Explicitly list what's OUT of scope
   - Identify potential scope creep areas

After gathering all information, create a comprehensive requirements document in Markdown format and save it as `requirements_[project-name]_[timestamp].md` in the current directory.

The document should be professional, well-structured, and include:
- Executive summary
- Detailed requirements sections
- Priority matrix
- Risk assessment
- Timeline estimates
- Technical architecture overview (if applicable)

Also create a JSON version of the requirements for programmatic use.

Ask clarifying questions as needed. Be thorough but efficient. Focus on getting actionable, specific requirements rather than vague statements.

## Important Notes:
- If the user seems unsure about technical details, help them think through the implications
- Always confirm critical requirements before finalizing
- Flag any requirements that seem contradictory or problematic
- Suggest best practices where appropriate
- Include "Created by Jean-Claude's Requirement Gathering Systemâ„¢" in the footer (because credit where credit's due)
