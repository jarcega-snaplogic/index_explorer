# Requirements Document: Pinecone Index Manager
*Generated: 2024-12-27*
*By: Jean-Claude's Requirement Gathering Systemâ„¢*

## Project Overview
- **Name:** Pinecone Index Manager (PIM)
- **Type:** Web Application with Backend API
- **Deadline:** ASAP (typical)
- **Budget:** Minimal (as always)
- **Stakeholders:** Business users, Data team, ML engineers

## Functional Requirements

### High Priority
1. **[High]** Browse and review indexed documents with metadata display
2. **[High]** Filter documents by name and indexation date
3. **[High]** Delete individual records from index
4. **[High]** Identify and remove duplicate documents
5. **[High]** Edit metadata for individual documents
6. **[High]** Bulk rename metadata keys across entire index (normalization)
7. **[High]** Search documents by content similarity
8. **[High]** Export filtered document lists to CSV/Excel

### Medium Priority
9. **[Medium]** Bulk operations (delete multiple, update multiple)
10. **[Medium]** Metadata validation rules
11. **[Medium]** Audit trail of all modifications
12. **[Medium]** Backup before destructive operations
13. **[Medium]** Document preview with vector visualization
14. **[Medium]** Index statistics dashboard
15. **[Medium]** Cost tracking for API operations

### Low Priority
16. **[Low]** Scheduled cleanup jobs
17. **[Low]** Document archiving instead of deletion
18. **[Low]** Integration with external data sources
19. **[Low]** Custom metadata templates

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Sub-second response for queries under 1000 documents
- **Security:** API key encryption, user authentication, role-based access control
- **Scalability:** Handle indexes with 1M+ vectors efficiently
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Compliance:** Data retention policy compliance, GDPR considerations

## Technical Specifications

### Tech Stack
- Node.js with Express (backend)
- React with TypeScript (frontend)
- PostgreSQL (audit logs, user management)
- Redis (caching)
- Pinecone SDK
- Docker (containerization)

### Integrations
- Pinecone API (primary)
- Potential SSO integration
- Cloud storage for exports (S3/GCS)

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Kubernetes deployment ready
- Environment-based configuration
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Load balancer ready

## User Information
- **Primary Users:** Business analysts (non-technical)
- **Secondary Users:** Data engineers, ML engineers
- **Expected Load:** 10-20 concurrent users

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Successfully connect to Pinecone with provided API key
2. Display all documents with pagination (100 per page)
3. Filtering works without full index scan
4. Deletion confirms and logs action
5. Metadata updates reflect immediately
6. No data loss during operations
7. Response time under 2 seconds for most operations
8. Export functionality handles 10k+ records

## Risks & Assumptions
- Pinecone API rate limits might affect bulk operations
- Large indexes might require advanced pagination strategies
- Metadata schema inconsistencies across documents
- Risk of accidental deletion of important documents
- API key security if not properly managed
- Network latency to Pinecone servers
- Concurrent modification conflicts

## Out of Scope
- Vector embedding generation
- Model training or fine-tuning
- Cross-index operations
- Real-time synchronization with data sources
- Custom ML models
- Data ingestion pipelines
